## 2x2 MIMO-OFDM Simulation with MMSE Detection

This project simulates a 2x2 MIMO-OFDM wireless communication system in MATLAB using QPSK modulation and MMSE detection. The goal is to evaluate the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance over a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs)

## üìå Key Features

- **MIMO System**: 2 transmit and 2 receive antennas  
- **OFDM Parameters**: 64 subcarriers, 16-point cyclic prefix  
- **Modulation**: QPSK  
- **Detection**: Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)  
- **Channel**: Frequency-selective Rayleigh fading  
- **Output**: BER vs. SNR performance curve

## üß† Concepts Explained

| Term              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **OFDM**          | Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing splits a signal into multiple subcarriers to reduce multipath effects. |
| **MIMO**          | Multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver improve reliability and increase data rates. |
| **QPSK**          | Quadrature Phase Shift Keying transmits 2 bits per symbol by shifting the phase of the carrier. |
| **Cyclic Prefix** | A portion of the OFDM symbol added to combat inter-symbol interference due to multipath. |
| **MMSE Detection**| A linear method used at the receiver to minimize the mean square error in symbol estimation. |
| **SNR (dB)**      | Signal-to-Noise Ratio in decibels; measures how strong the signal is relative to background noise. |
| **BER**           | Bit Error Rate; the ratio of bit errors to total transmitted bits, used to quantify communication performance. |
